# GenshinRollSimulator
I'm too dumb (lazy) to package this in a nice way for you. Running this simulator will require you to compile this yourself, and have some very basic knowledge about editing source code.
If you want the TL;DR regarding my personal results, whales will favor the new system, and f2p will favor the current system.
